# Data2020_final

Scripts used to produce project results (cleaning, merging, EDA, and modeling) for Jason Terry, Guanhua Zhu, and Spencer Boyum.

Most of the EDA and all of the model building is performed in project_notebook2.ipynp. 

We have also included the data used for our analysis. The file acs_police_clean.csv is the primary dataset used for our analysis - it is the resulting dataset after the police killings and ACS datasets are merged and cleaned. dem_data.csv contains demographic information for each state, and was merged with acs_police_clean.csv to perform our analysis.
